A very silly show. The acting is over the top and the plot is ridiculous. One of the big mysteries is answered by a character using magic to enter his own subconscious memories. Even Song Weilong's attractiveness, which has the potential to carry a mediocre show, is somehow weakened by the costumes. 

It's based on a gay romance novel (《张公案》by 大风刮过) but most of the gayness is washed away to appease the censors. To be extra sure that the subtext (which I'll admit is very cute at times) and lack of hetero romance aren't misinterpreted, in the last 10 minutes of the last episode someone's like *now that everything's resolved, you can go see your kid [that we never mentioned] who's been out of town this whole time! your dead wife [that we also never mentioned] is definitely smiling down on us from heaven now*.
